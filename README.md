# AFRL-Water-Cooler
A joint project of a mechanical senior design team and SPARC for the Air Force Research Lab Challenge in 2015

During the fall and spring semesters of 2015, a team of SPARC members worked with a senior design team to create a method of cooling off soliders in heated combat environments. Ideally, the requisites for the project were that it be under two pounds and be able to lower the core body temperature to prevent and possible help with heat stroke while in the field. The challenge page is located here:

After many trials, it was found that it was very difficult to affect core body temperature with external sources, so the team worked to develop a method of cooling drinking water without the need for a fridge - since most water available to soliders in the field would be well above 100 degrees Farenheit. 

Much of the work done by SPARC involved construction of the control circuitry for the thermoelectric compoonents. The final design report with its details has been attached to this repository.

Auburn placed 2nd place in competition for its design. Due to time contraints, much of the design was not able to be fleshed out before presentation in Boston.
